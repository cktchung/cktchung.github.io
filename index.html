        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, I am Chloe Chung, a freshman at the University of California, Riverside. I majored in pre-business and wanted to concentrate on management. A little background information for myself is I went to the US in the year of 2019. Before that, I lived and studied in Hong Kong. That year I made a decision that changed my life. Coming to the United States is my own choice, I have always wanted to since I was little. I think it‚Äôs a good chance to live in a different part of the world and a good way to practice English. I am glad that my family supported my decision too. I love my life in Riverside, in the US. At the same time, I was away from my family. One of the reasons I applied back to the university in Hong Kong was to be with my family. However, these few years made me become a lot more independent. Independent as in the way I think and act. When we are little, our parents help us to decide and choose what they think is the best k for us. Now, I make my own choices and know that I can not regret it. The most compliments that I get from others are always the most mature and caring one in the group. I think that‚Äôs also because I am the eldest child in the family. As well as being independent, I can work well in teamwork too. I have many experiences working as a team and the most recent one is the part time job that I got. I started a part-time job at Starbucks in target. We as a team have to communicate and work out our schedule together. Also, I can practice my speaking skills through this work. I was required to communicate with the guests and since I am a faster learner, I picked up things really fast in my work. I can definitely see the improvements on the way I talk and be more comfortable to talk in front of more people.
						


<br><br>

        On the other hand, I am an outgoing person and love meeting new people. I used to swim and play basketball but the pandemic stopped me from that. Especially people in Dougherty are really serious about sports, it‚Äôs hard for me to catch up after a year of rest while high school makes me exhausted too. I went from a sports person to more focused on academic and volunteering experiences. That is also how I met a lot of friends that fill my high school life up. I am glad that I see the changes in myself in this school. Most people are competitive and this made me work even harder. Furthermore, I joined clubs and organizations outside of school to build up my social skills and leadership experience. I tried to put effort and be one of the officers to help out and be involved more. I am really proud that I got a president award after just a year.
<br><br>

        From all these activities, I found myself loving to communicate with people, to work with people. That‚Äôs how I figured I wanted to get into the human resources and management field. In addition to that, I liked things related to business. I realized that after I took my first business class. On top of that, management may require problem solving skills which I had a few experiences with. The most remarkable would be the time where an event happened from the club that I joined, one of the officers miscommunicated with the site manager and two different clubs had to share the place. People get worried but I came up with a solution and talked it through with the site manager. I convinced the others and we ended up agreeing to my idea which separated us into two different areas. I got appreciation from people and I am glad I helped. I love my life and my family. Whenever I got really stressed about school and no one supported me in here, I told myself work hard pays off. I was pleased I got raised under a positive family. I think positively no matter what happens and I believe part of it is because of my religion. What‚Äôs more, I have a balanced life since my life motto is ‚Äúwork hard, play hard‚Äù and I think everyone deserves it.
